metabolism, we've kind of even started to touch on it already, right? So if we started talking about gluconeogenesis and about glucagon, there's some of the last slides on the gluconeogenesis lecture, lecture 28 that kind of talked about glycogen and glucagon. Let's look at glycogen.


================================================================================

================================================================================

The active form of the enzyme, now we're going to go back to something that we've looked at before, is called the R state. That makes sense. You all start building on the stuff we previously learned, right? The R state is what binds things, right? The top states what this. So the R state is usually where you have your active site available, your relaxed state, right? So the active form of the enzyme is in the R state. The inactive form is denoted as the T state, TOT state, TENT state, whatever you want to call it. A and P is going to promote the conversion to the active state. See all of this is just making perfect sense, right? Because this is what you already know. We're just building on what you already know. ATP and glucose 6P and a length of caffeine favor the conversion to the inactive T state. Why caffeine, you may know? Yeah, it's a stimulant that gives energy, right? You break down. So does he even know what caffeine looks like? Yeah. You all seeing it? No. I want nitrogen groups in it. Yes, it helps with walk the face, okay? So as you can hear, some people sometimes say, I'm just running on pure caffeine, right? That can happen. Eventually you'll crash the, so please eat something. So a significant confirmation change occurs at the subunit interface. So we talked about how we have these two towers, right? And we have the two active sites in the middle, right? And all of this stuff right here is forming the interface, right? So if we have this forming the interface and we have something that activates it, right? Or inhibits it either way, that's going to cause a significant conformational change. The conformational change at the interface is linked to a structural change at the active site that's going to affect catalysis. This just reminds me a lot of what? What did we see that upon binding there was a structural change? We saw that as soon as oxygen came, right, it kind of pulled that out, if you look down, right? Same kind of thing, y'all, you already know this, okay? So glycogen metabolism is just a different pathway, but it's using all of the same things that you already know, okay? So a conformational change at the interface is now going to be linked to a structural change at the active site, which affects catalysis.


================================================================================
FILE: media11.m4a
================================================================================

Foss-for-relation of C-14, so this is something new. Foss-for-relation of C-14 is going to convert the less active enzyme, Foss-for-relase B, to the more active Foss-for-relase A. We did have a little bit of this when we talked about our what? Our multifunctional, our tandem enzyme where Foss-for-relation can make it more or less active, right? So this guy, we can Foss-for-relate C-13, and now it's going to convert the less active enzyme to the more active. So in this case, kind of exactly, if we Foss-for-relate this, then we're kind of turning it more on. Okay? So we're going to make it more on. Foss-for-relation causes a large conformational change and converts the enzyme to a form in which it's much less sensitive to allosteric regulation. Okay? So this is just another level of regulation here, because we can Foss-for-relate it, and now that makes it less sensitive to whether or not there's ATP or whatever else present, right? Because we've already caused a conformational change that would probably overshadow whatever else would happen if there's an allosteric around. Okay? The A form is less sensitive to allosteric regulation than the B form. Well, that makes sense because the A form we just converted to, and that was the more active form, right? So less sensitive to allosteric regulation than the B form. Foss-for-relation converts the enzyme from a form that is allosterically regulated, which is what I said, to a persistently active one. Because like I said, once we Foss-for-related this guy and caused a major conformational change, really those allosteric effectors are not going to have much, much say, right? We've already changed enough to where that's really not going to have much planeness. And so now we're no longer really allosterically regulated, we're just on. Okay? Foss-for-relation just turned it on. That's it.


================================================================================

================================================================================

So phosphorylase A, the equilibrium is shifted towards the R state. So when we're going in phosphorylase A, the equilibrium is shifted towards the R state. Thus, the phosphorylase at inside is more active with no requirements from allosteric activators we don't need them. We've already undergone the conformational change. So phosphorylation reduces the value. This is where we're going back to our models. Phosphorylation reduces the value of L, the taut over the relaxed form in the MWC model. So the equilibrium between the taut and the relaxed forms in the MWC model reduces the value of it.


================================================================================
FILE: media13.m4a
================================================================================

That's not the important part. What I want you to know is how to regulate. Okay. So, let's look at this, glycogen phosphorylase. As I said, kinases are responsible for a lot of our regulations. So this is a cascade regulation via kinases. So the phosphorylase kinase, that phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase, is itself regulated by phosphorylation, right? So don't let that trip you out. But yes, not only can the enzyme that's doing the regulation, phosphorylate, but it also can be phosphorylated to turn off. Okay. And a lot of that, you'll see a lot of that is going through your classes because a lot of extracellular signals come in, and it kicks off this cascade of all of these phosphorylation events, but turns on certain enzymes whenever a stimulus is received. Okay. So we see in this case, right? A hormone. We've got epinephrine, adrenaline, some glucogon, whatever. So a hormone, we have inactive, anylcyclase, you know what that is, right? No. See me know what anylcyclase is. It makes sickle-cane. It does go to that, yes. Oh, that's, that's going to be a Google question. I'm going to have y'all Google that. So glucogon is made in response to low blood sugar, okay? And that stimulates mobilization of glycogen. So if you have glucogon, which was on one of your last slides, right? So glucogon, right? It's since a signal, we've got cyclic AMP, right? The neck's signal, since a signal. And the adrenaline prepares the organism for mobilization of large amounts of energy could be fight of light, right? And the event that's epinephrine, right? So we have the hormone signaling. It's going to signal inactive, anylcyclase, it's going to become active. That's going to signal camp cyclic AMP. So we're going to have ATP with that. And then we're going to have inactive camp dependent protein kinase is now going to be phosphorylated to be active camp dependent protein kinase. So all of these things are getting phosphorylated through all these steps, okay? Then we're going to take that active camp dependent protein kinase and we're going to phosphorylate again, okay? So we can see that we can change states via the phosphorylation of our phosphorylase kinase, right? We can turn it on or off. Same thing for our glycogen phosphorylase B, it can be on or off, depending on its phosphorylation. The glucogon secretion is inhibited by insulin. Do you all remember that flag and showed insulin? Insulin is going to inhibit glucogon secretion and diabetics, though, because we have talked about diabetes, Melodis, right? And diabetics glycogen is degraded even when glucose is high. Okay? So glycogen is degraded even when glucose is high.


================================================================================
FILE: media14.m4a
================================================================================

So let's talk about a camp. Okay, this is going to be cyclic AMP. So here we see an ATP, right? We're going to undergo reaction with adenyl cyclase, and we're going to make cyclic AMP. So camp is a second messenger. You will hear that a lot. Camp is a second messenger. Okay, so under, underline it. Cyclic AMP is a second messenger, because what is a second messenger do? It transduces the message of the hormone. Okay, so after the hormone signaling has come in, camp says the next message. Okay.


================================================================================
FILE: media15.m4a
================================================================================

And here's AdNil cyclase. So now you didn't have to Google it. Here it is. AdNil cyclase is membrane associated. Because how else are you going to get the signal from the outside, right? So AdNil cyclase is membrane associated. And this mechanism, as you can see, we've got the hormone coming in. We have a hormone receptor. Yes, you have them, right? We have hormone receptors there. They're associated with G proteins. We have AdNil cyclase over there. And kind of a... Oh no. A terrible,ish colored pinkish tube, right? Looks like salmon. I don't like the color salmon. But it's over there. It looks like a little tube, right? So what happens upon signaling with the hormone, as you can see, and beat in the little second section here, is we start beating this signal, right? So now the gamma and beta of the G proteins, those seven minutes have moved over. We've got alpha, has been freed alpha GTP. As we've undergo some GTP hydrolysis, just you know? And we end up with a camp signal. So ATP camp. We slow the GTP as activity. As the alpha hydrolyzes GTP to GTP, so that's getting back off of there. Okay? And then we see this guy right down here. We still have the signal, right? Everything still looks the same at that point. But the G alpha GTP is going to disassociate from the AdNil cyclase and return back to that guy. Okay? So it's ready for the next signal. That was all it had to do. It's just go over there and tell us guys something. Okay? And then once it's gone back, then it's an active. So this is the activation of AdNil cyclase right over here. Okay? So this mechanism amplifies the signal because one hormone receptor complex can activate mini G proteins. And mini camp molecules can be synthesized before the G protein disassociates. So you see how it's making all of these camp molecules? Mini can be made before that alpha GTP disassociates. Okay? So of course, if one little signal can give us lots of signal, then that's obviously amplification, right? Something weaker gave us a lot. So that's how we're amplifying this signal and that's how this functions as a secondary messenger.


================================================================================
FILE: media16.m4a
================================================================================

So let's look at that Camp Dependent Protein kinase. We've actually looked at this guy before, right? Camp activates Camp Dependent Protein kinase, okay? So after we make cyclic AMP, it activates Camp Dependent Protein kinase. Camp binding causes this association of the C subunit, which we've talked about before. I think this actual slide was on when before, right? Which is the active kinase, right? See when off, we have two active kinases, right? Two C. Those are going to go in phosphorylate phosphorylase kinase. And Camp Dependent Protein kinase is an example of enzyme regulation by binding to a regulatory protein. That's the take-home part from that, okay? So I would underline that is that Camp Dependent Protein kinase is an example of an enzyme regulated by binding to a regulatory protein. And we even talked about this back when we talked about enzyme regulation, okay? So again, we're just building on what you've previously learned, okay?


================================================================================
FILE: media17.m4a
================================================================================

So now let's talk about glycogen synthesis. Because we just talked about catabolism, right? So now let's talk about enabolism, a biosynthetic pathway. So glycogen synthesis pathway is obviously going to be different from its degradation. Glucose is activated for glycogen synthesis by attachment to urodene diphosphate to form the sugar nuclei tied UDP glucose. We saw that briefly in one of our slides, I didn't get into it too much. But formation of this UDP glucose from glucose 1 phosphate and UTP is actually catalyzed by UDP glucose phosphorylase. That would be the take home from that is that glucose is activated for glycogen synthesis, right? Because we say glucose can go several things, right? So glycogen synthesis is going to be attached to a urodene diphosphate. And it's going to form a different sugar, right? Because now we have a glucose, but it's got an attachment to it. And that sugar is a nucleotide UDP glucose. And then formation of that was catalyzed by UDP glucose phosphorylase.


================================================================================
FILE: media18.m4a
================================================================================

This is a look at that mechanism. The mechanism of the UDP glucose phosphorylase reaction is going to involve an attack by a phosphate oxygen of glucose 1p on the alpha phosphorous of UTP. And this is going to release a pyrophosphate anion. So we basically end up with a hydrolysis of two inorganic phosphates, PPI, to provide the driving force for this reaction. So the release of those is going to help push this forward. So we can see that we have a nucleophilic attack. We've got this oxygen group down here on glucose 1p, right? It's attacking that phosphate right there at the very beginning of that tricosate, right? It's going to attack it right there. And then what you're going to end up with is this guy attached. So this guy, because we've released two phosphates, okay? So two inorganic phosphates go off, and now the glucose is attached.


================================================================================
FILE: media19.m4a
================================================================================

So let's look at the next step. So after we've done that, we're going to do glycogen synthase. So glycogen synthase catalyzes the formation of those alpha-1, 4 glycocytic bonds that we've been talking about. We've been talking about breaking them all of this time, but now we're going to talk about forming them. Okay? So glycogen synthase is going to form the alpha-1, 4 glycocytic bonds in glycogen. The large glycogen particle is built around a single protein called glycogenin. So just think glycogen, right? And then almost think of genesis, genin. Okay? So glycogenin, that's going to be the large initial part. Okay? So the large glycogen particle is built around a single protein called glycogenin at the core. The first glucose is linked to a tyrosine hydroxyl group on the protein. And then sugar units are then added by the action of glycogen synthase, right? So they're just adding it through these alpha-1, 4 glycocytic bonds. Glicogen synthase is going to transfer glycosyl units from UDP glucose to C4 hydroxyl at a non-reducing end of the glycogen strand. Okay? So the hydroxyl group. An oxonium ion intermediate is formed. Okay? That's this guy right here. And you can see the difference between him and these others over here, right? An oxonium ion intermediate is formed. And then you have a little bit of a charge change there.


================================================================================
FILE: media2.m4a
================================================================================

It's a metabolism. So let's look at the degradation. So starch and glycogen degradation, we obtain our glucose from storage or from diet, right? Predominantly, you want to eat it. And that's just because that's how we like to uptake our nutrients as we do it by consuming. Now, in the event that you have a very restrictive diet, which we've talked about, if you have a very restrictive diet, then you start breaking down. And so then you can do that from your storage. So this was a test question, AFA AMALE, it's an endoglycosides. That is found in your saliva, right? So in the minute you start eating and it's breaking down, it's also found in your pancreatic secretions. And that's responsible for hydrolyzing the alpha-1-4 linkage. Right, so this is just a repeat of what we've seen before. It cleaves dietary amylopectin or glycogen to maltose. So that's something that we didn't look at was what it cleaved it to. So we know that AFA-1-4 linkage is a broken. We now have maltose, which is a disaccharide. Disaccharide means two saccharides, right? A maltotrioce, which is a trisaccharide and other small oligosaccharides. This is the interesting thing about AFA AMALE. It's active on either side of the branch point, but the activity is reduced near the branch point. Okay, so if I am an amylopectin, okay, so I'm a starch and I have this branch over here and this branch over here. What will happen is we have all of these little alpha-1-4s, right? So I've got all of these little saccharides in here. It's gonna come in and it's gonna take off just some towards the end, okay? And it's gonna take off more. It's gonna take off more. But as it gets closer to here to the actual branch point, something else steps in because it's not as functional but closer it's the branch. Okay, back when the other enzyme comes in. And the other enzyme is what I've always been calling over our last couple of lectures, the debranching enzyme. That's the easy way for me to remember it is the debranching enzyme. And that is it cleaves limit dextrins. Limit dextrins means you're just getting close to the end. The two activities of the debranching enzyme, it transfers trisaccharide groups and cleaves the remaining single glucose units from the main chains. So the interesting thing about the debranching enzyme is an or to make branches what kind of glycocytic bond is right here? Alpha-1-6, right? We just said amylase doesn't two alpha-1-6, right? Only hydrolysis the alpha-1-4s. So it'll do the alpha-1-4s until it gets the kind of close to the branch. And then the alpha-1-6 will come in, okay? Natural debranching enzyme. So the first thing we're going to do is to make sure that the is the right amount of the blood. So the first thing we're going to do is to make sure that the is the right amount of the blood. So the first thing we're going to do is to make sure that the is the right amount of the blood. So the first thing we're going to do is to make sure that the is the right amount of the blood. So the first thing we're going to do is to make sure that the


================================================================================
FILE: media20.m4a
================================================================================

So let's look at that branching enzyme because now we said we can form the alpha-1-4s, right? So now we're going to have to form the alpha-1-6s. So formation of glycogen branches is catalyzed by the branching enzyme. So it catalyzes them, okay? Six or seven residue segments of a growing glycogen chain are transferred. So as it does with degradation, it's also going to transfer some to make, okay? So we had deep branching, right? Just take some off. We got branching, put some on. Y'all, that should be easy to remember. Deep branching takes off three, right? And then branching puts on six. Easy to remember. Deep branching three, branching six, okay? Six or seven? Six or seven residue segments of a growing glycogen chain are transferred to the C6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue on the same or a nearby chain. So on the top part, you see it on a nearby chain and then the bottom one, you can see it. So we've got the branching enzyme head in there and he's decided to put this guy right here. He transferred seven residue terminal segment to a C6 OH group right there. So a C6, right? Because now we're forming what? What kind of bond? Yes, alpha-1, 6, right? So that's going to be easy to remember with the C6, right? Because we're forming an alpha-1, 6 glycocytic bond for branches. Right? Alpha-1, 6 for glycocytic bonds for branches.


================================================================================
FILE: media21.m4a
================================================================================

So even on the other one, it would be easy to remember that you're going to be on the C4 carbon, right? Because what is it? It's an alpha-1-4, right? So you don't have to remember the number and you just got to know what kind of bond you're looking at. So glycogen metabolism, I said that digestive breakdown is not regulated, right? Unregulated. Whereas glycogen metabolism is highly regulated. So once we've actually stored it, that's a highly regulated process. And it's going to have reciprocal control of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase. You don't want to be phosphorylating it and breaking it down and then also making it at the same time. So GP, that's glycogen phosphorylase. Allosterically activated by AMP, right? We said it's allosterically activated by AMP. Because we need some energy, right? But it is inhibited by ATP, glucose 6P, and caffeine. GS, so glycogen synthase, is stimulated by glucose 6P. And both of these enzymes, underline it, underline it. Both of these enzymes are regulated by covalent modification, which is phosphorylation. Okay? Phosphorylation. Regulates the activity of both of these enzymes. Yes, they're also allosterically regulated, but please remember that phosphorylation supersedes. Okay? If we phosphorylated, the allosteric doesn't matter anymore.


================================================================================
FILE: media22.m4a
================================================================================

So let's look at the glycogen synthase regulation. So this is to actually make it. It is phosphorylated at multiple sites by protein kinases, including the Camp Deprinted Protein kinase. Phosphorylated glycogen synthase has a lower activity and is allosterically activated by high concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate. Okay, so allosterically activated by high concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate because we have a lot it's needed to store some. Okay, so we're going to make some glycogen. Okay, at least nine serine residues are phosphorylated. So that's a lot, right? So we only phosphorylated what in the other one? What? Serine? What serine, right? Serine what? Serine 14. It's only one serine to control the phosphorylase activity. But for synthase we are going to actually phosphorylate nine residues. Nine serine residues are phosphorylated and four different protein kinases are involved. So a lot more heavily regulated maybe on the making, right? Dephosphorylation is carried out by phosphoprotein phosphatase 1. We actually saw that one of our last slides of gluconeogenesis. So dephosphorylation is carried out by phosphoprotein phosphatase 1. PP1 which is probably how you'll hear me call it, in activates glycogen phosphorylase and activates glycogen synthase. So this guy does both, okay? He inactivates glycogen phosphorylase and activates glycogen synthase. Heads up for my class. Your, we call those problem sets, I made it. Guess what's on it? This, okay? Pretty much a lot of what we've been talking about today. Okay, I'm a pathways person and I'm definitely a phosphorylate person, okay? So a lot of mine is regulation. All of my stuff, you all should be able to Google, find it in your book or find it even on your slides because some of it is literally from that. Okay, so this problem set should not take you long to do and I expect you to do it well and get a turn in, okay? That being said, yes, you can go to workshop because they will work through the pathways for you. Okay, defosphorylated enzyme here has a high activity and does not require glucose six phosphate for activity. So see, again, phosphorylating, actually, defosphorylating that guy, we phosphorylated the other guy, defosphorylated this guy, defosphorylated enzyme has a high activity and does not require glucose six phosphate for activity. Phosphorylation has an opposite effect, right? Because one, you phosphorylate it to make it just constitutively active. Okay, this guy, you defosphorylate it, it's pretty much constitutively active. Okay, so phosphorylation has opposite effects on glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase. Okay, underline it, underline it.


================================================================================
FILE: media23.m4a
================================================================================

So there are hormones that regulate these. Storage and utilization of tissue glycogen and just other aspects of metabolism, obviously are regulated by hormones, including glucogon, epinephrine, glucocorticoids, insulin. Everybody's heard about insulin in response to increased blood glucose. It triggers glycogen synthesis because it's trying to take some of that glucose out of the blood, right? So we're going to synthesize glycogen for storage. So glycogen synthesis when glucose, blood glucose rises. So between meals, blood glucose is about 70 to 90. Glucose rises to 150 after a meal and then returns to normal within two to three hours. Insulin is secreted from the pancreas to the liver in response to an increase in blood glucose. And it lowers blood glucose rapidly. So please know that insulin lowers blood glucose rapidly in several ways, including stimulating glycogen synthesis and inhibiting glycogen breakdown. So insulin does both, right? Once turned on, once turned off. Glucogon and epinephrine stimulate glycogen breakdown because we need to, right? Epinephrine especially, fight or flight, right? We've got to make a massive response. We've got to have a lot of energy to deal with our stresses. And so that's going to stimulate glycogen breakdown.


================================================================================
FILE: media24.m4a
================================================================================

So again, by any of insulin to the plasma membrane receptors in the liver and the muscles, triggers protein. Now why would we want to have it in the liver and the muscles? Oh, that's a trick question. Why? Where is glycogen stored? And, uh, is it stored in the kidneys? Is it stored in the liver? Is it stored anywhere else? Is it stored in the liver? Oh, yes. So would you want those receptors there? Yes. Do you want to be able to make some and store it there? Yes. Okay, y'all. It's Friday. I know y'all are tired. So that would be why you would have those receptors there. So, in the liver and the muscles, triggers protein kinase castates. We've talked about protein kinase castates. That's stimuli glycogen synthesis. All right. Insulin's effect includes stimulation of lipid synthesis. What it knows what a lipid is. Glicogen synthesis, protein synthesis, glycolysis, and active transport. And at the same time that it's stimulating all of these, it has to turn off the other side, right? So we have reciprocal regulation again. Something's going up. Something's going down. So what's going down? What's getting inhibited is gluconeogenesis. We certainly don't want to do that. We don't want to make more blood glucose when we're trying to store it. And lipid breakdown, right? Because we're actually making lipids. We just said lipid synthesis. Glucose uptake is going to provide the substrate for glycogen synthesis, which makes sense, right? We're trying to get that glucose out of the blood. And glucose 6p, we've talked about that guy a lot, glucose 6p. And those both allosterically activate the otherwise inactive form of glycogen synthase. So glycogen synthase is allosterically activated by glucose 6p, right? And just glucose, right? And glucose 6p is what? We just talked about how glucose comes into all of this, right? It's phosphorylated, right? We talked about phosphorylation. We even said it gets phosphorylated on what spot. And then it gets moved to what spot. You all are like, I don't remember that. That was Wednesday. Okay. It gets phosphorylated on what spot? And then it goes through a mutated reaction, which moves it to what spot? Oh, there we go. They're alive. They're alive. Oh, y'all, check your pulse. All right. So let's look at this guy. Okay. We've got an insulin receptor. We see some insulin there. Okay. Does anybody know what this little squiggly, worm-looking thing is over there? Well, that's got that bound to that. I'm talking about in the plasma membrane. Anybody know what that is? What is it? A G-C-P-R. Tell them what that is. There's seven philates that have a G-D-P-P-P-P to connect with the plant. They have a cascade. Did everybody hear that? Hina? Say it now, William. This is a seven helix protein that have G-D-K-F-F-B-D-W. I think it was attached to the C-C-P-P-P. Then that would initiate a second lesson here. We have a cascade reaction. This is a seven transmembrane protein. Okay. It just spans the membrane seven times. They are called G-P-C-Rs. That stands for G-proteined coupled receptor. Okay. G-P-C-R stands for G-proteined coupled receptors. Okay. They are responsible for a lot of signal cascades. We can see here. We see some glucose outside of the plasma membrane. It says, oh, there's glucose. What is that doing? That's telling. Actually, what we're having here is we've got insulin. We're never mind our glucose. We've got our insulin, our insulin receptor. It's touching. You see it up there? It's touching. We're sending signals. We've got a protein kind of cascade going in two different directions. We can go this way because we said we have to do what? We have to turn stuff on. We have to turn stuff off. Right? That's going on to simulate glycogen synthesis, lipid synthesis, protein synthesis, all of these synthesizing reactions. We're turning off everything that's going to break down stuff. Okay. So we're going to have all of these different cascade going off. We can see that we're turning things on. We see that guy that we said we had to have a lymphosporylate. Remember, there's one of them that has how many sites for phosphorylation. It has a certain number of serings. How many? I thought y'all might remember that one guy that had serine 14, but no, not. That's what that little guy is with all those little phosphorylation sites sticking out of him. That's not nine, but that's okay. So this is just a little diagram of some of the things that go on. Blue four, that's in response to your glucose. And so we can see that we're going through allosteric activation. And we're still turning on glycogen synthase. Okay. And that's just because there's glucose out there. We say glucose is an allosteric acovena. Right? Glucose and glucose 6p.
