**Q4. Why does the PPP include a reversible non-oxidative phase?**
✅ **A. To interconvert sugars based on cellular needs for DNA synthesis or energy production**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“These steps… produce ribose-5-phosphate… Some carbon is directed to glycolysis or gluconeogenesis.”
🧠 **Simple:**
This part of the PPP is flexible — if the cell needs DNA, it gives ribose; if it needs energy, it gives glycolytic sugars.
🔊 **Audio Transcript:**
“PPP products can go into glycolysis or back to make ribose.”

---

**Q5. Why is the PPP especially active in tissues like liver and adipose cells?**
✅ **A. These tissues use PPP for fatty acid synthesis**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“It operates mostly in the cytosol of liver and adipose cells… NADPH is used in cytosol for fatty acid synthesis.”
🧠 **Simple:**
Liver and fat cells use PPP to build stuff (like fats); RBCs use it to stay protected from damage.

“Occurs mostly in liver and adipose tissue due to fatty acid synthesis.”

---

**Q6. Why is ribose-5-phosphate important in the non-oxidative phase of PPP?**
✅ **A. It is a precursor for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis**

**Q7. Why can intermediates from the PPP re-enter glycolysis?**
✅ **A. To meet cellular energy demands by converting sugars back to energy pathways**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“Fructose six phosphate… and glyceraldehyde three phosphate… can go back to glycolysis.”
🧠 **Simple:**
If the cell doesn't need ribose, it can recycle those sugars back to make ATP.
🔊 **Audio Transcript:**
“Fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-P feed back into glycolysis.”

---

**Q8. Why does G6PDH activity reflect a cell’s redox status?**
✅ **A. NADP⁺ activates the enzyme, while NADPH inhibits it**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is allosterically stimulated by NADP⁺… inhibited by NADPH.”
🧠 **Simple:**
If there's lots of NADPH, the cell says 'we're good'; if not, G6PDH gets busy.
🔊 **Audio Transcript:**
“G6PDH is inhibited by NADPH, activated by NADP⁺.”

---

**Q9. Why is PPP flexibility critical for balancing biosynthesis and energy needs?**
✅ **A. It enables flux toward nucleotide production or glycolysis depending on cellular state**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“Depending on the body’s state… ribulose-5-phosphate… will go toward DNA or glycolysis.”
🧠 **Simple:**
The pathway adapts: it builds DNA if needed, or feeds glycolysis for energy.
🔊 **Audio Transcript:**
“Cell chooses pathway based on need for DNA vs energy.”

---

**Q10. Why does a high NADPH/NADP⁺ ratio inhibit the PPP?**
✅ **A. It signals that biosynthetic reducing power needs are already met**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“NADPH inhibits glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.”
🧠 **Simple:**
When NADPH is high, the pathway shuts off because the cell doesn’t need more.
🔊 **Audio Transcript:**
“High NADPH inhibits the enzyme to prevent waste.”

---

**Q11. Why is glycogen phosphorylase regulated by both allosteric effectors and covalent modification?**
✅ **A. To allow energy-dependent activation and inhibition depending on ATP and AMP levels**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“AMP is an allosteric activator… ATP and glucose-6-P are inhibitors… phosphorylation converts it to a persistently active form.”
🧠 **Simple:**
The enzyme listens to both hormones and energy signals like ATP and AMP.
🔊 **Audio Transcript:**
“AMP activates; phosphorylation locks it into active state.”

---

**Q12. Why does phosphorylation of Ser14 activate glycogen phosphorylase?**
✅ **A. It induces a change that makes the enzyme persistently active**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“Phosphorylation of serine-14 converts… phosphorylase b to phosphorylase a… persistently active.”
🧠 **Simple:**
Phosphorylation flips the enzyme into “always-on” mode, so it doesn’t need AMP.
🔊 **Audio Transcript:**
“Phosphorylation removes the need for AMP.”

---

**Q13. Why is cyclic AMP (cAMP) important in glycogen metabolism?**
✅ **A. It acts as a second messenger to transmit hormone signals**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“Cyclic AMP is a second messenger: transduces the message of the hormone.”
🧠 **Simple:**
Hormones can’t enter your cells, so cAMP delivers the message inside to trigger enzyme action.
🔊 **Audio Transcript:**
“cAMP is the internal messenger for hormone signals.”

---

**Q14. Why is UDP-glucose required in glycogen synthesis?**
✅ **A. It is the activated form of glucose required by glycogen synthase**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“Glucose is activated for glycogen synthesis by attachment to uridine diphosphate, to form… UDP-glucose.”
🧠 **Simple:**
UDP-glucose is a 'primed' version of glucose that’s easy for the enzyme to plug into glycogen.
🔊 **Audio Transcript:**
“Glucose must be activated into UDP-glucose first.”

---

**Q15. Why does AMP activate glycogen phosphorylase in muscle cells?**
✅ **A. It signals low energy, promoting glycogen breakdown**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“AMP is an allosteric activator of glycogen phosphorylase… Glycogen catabolism is stimulated when energy reserves are low.”
🧠 **Simple:**
When your muscles are low on energy, AMP tells enzymes to break down stored fuel (glycogen).
🔊 **Audio Transcript:**
“AMP means low energy, phosphorylase gets turned on.”

---

**Q16. Why is glycogen synthesis regulated reciprocally with glycogen breakdown?**
✅ **A. To prevent futile cycling and optimize energy storage vs. release**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“Phosphorylation has opposite effects on glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase.”
🧠 **Simple:**
One signal turns on storage and turns off breakdown, or vice versa — no wasted effort.
🔊 **Audio Transcript:**
“Phosphorylation inhibits synthase and activates phosphorylase.”

---

**Q17. Why does insulin promote glycogen synthesis?**
✅ **A. It activates pathways that dephosphorylate and activate glycogen synthase**

**Q18. Why is the branching enzyme important in glycogen metabolism?**
✅ **A. It creates new α(1→6) linkages, improving glycogen solubility and mobilization**
📜 **Slide Quote:**
“Formation of glycogen branches is catalyzed by the branching enzyme… transferred to C-6 hydroxyl group.”
