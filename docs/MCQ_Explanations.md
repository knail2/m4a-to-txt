**Q1. Explanation:**
- **Slide**: Lecture 29 Slide 15 - Adenylylcyclas eis membraneas s ociat ed

- **Quoted Source**: "And here's AdNil cyclase. So now you didn't have to Google it. Here it is. AdNil cyclase is membrane associated. Because how else are you going to get the signal from the outside, right? So AdNil cyclase is membrane associated. And this mechanism, as you can see, we've got the hormone coming in. We have a hormone receptor. Yes, you have them, right? We have hormone receptors there. They're associated with G proteins. We have AdNil cyclase over there. And kind of a... Oh no. A terrible,ish colored pinkish tube, right? Looks like salmon. I don't like the color salmon. But it's over there. It looks like a little tube, right? So what happens upon signaling with the hormone, as you can see, and beat in the little second section here, is we start beating this signal, right? So now the gamma and beta of the G proteins, those seven minutes have moved over. We've got alpha, has been freed alpha GTP. As we've undergo some GTP hydrolysis, just you know? And we end up with a camp signal. So ATP camp. We slow the GTP as activity. As the alpha hydrolyzes GTP to GTP, so that's getting back off of there. Okay? And then we see this guy right down here. We still have the signal, right? Everything still looks the same at that point. But the G alpha GTP is going to disassociate from the AdNil cyclase and return back to that guy. Okay? So it's ready for the next signal. That was all it had to do. It's just go over there and tell us guys something. Okay? And then once it's gone back, then it's an active. So this is the activation of AdNil cyclase right over here. Okay? So this mechanism amplifies the signal because one hormone receptor complex can activate mini G proteins. And mini camp molecules can be synthesized before the G protein disassociates. So you see how it's making all of these camp molecules? Mini can be made before that alpha GTP disassociates. Okay? So of course, if one little signal can give us lots of signal, then that's obviously amplification, right? Something weaker gave us a lot. So that's how we're amplifying this signal and that's how this functions as a secondary messenger."

**Q2. Explanation:**
- **Slide**: Lecture 29 Slide 5 - Glycogen phosphor ylase

- **Quoted Source**: "Charge granules. OK. So now let's look at that storage glycogen degradation. So we've consumed it, right? It's 100%. Inception, we broke it all down. I'm regulated. Digestion. And now we've stored things away. So we had stored our glycogen stores. Glycogen phosphorylase. So phosphorylase, right? We're going to remove a phosphate group. That's what it sounds like, right? So glycogen phosphorylase cleaves one sugar unit from the end of a glycogen chain, one sugar unit. So we saw where we could take off three, right? That the branching enzyme took off three. This guy's going to only take off one from the end of a glycogen chain and uses inorganic phosphate. We're actually going to phosphorylate here. We're going to use an inorganic phosphate to phosphorylate the glucose. Usually when you think of phosphorylating, you're thinking of kinases, activities, right? Whereas usually the other aizes are you're taking off. This one we're actually going to use inorganic phosphate to phosphorylate the glucose. And we phosphorylate glucose for what reasons? This avoids use of ATP to phosphorylate glucose is one thing. That's why we're using the inorganic phosphate. We don't want to use any energy for this. But we're not going to waste an ATP on it. We're just going to use an inorganic phosphate for that. So that's good. So we've avoided the use of ATP to phosphorylate this glucose. But we phosphorylate glucose, right, for all of the other things that needs to do, right? We go through glycogen all of these other things. What's in phosphorylate? Plus it keeps it where it's supposed to be. Remember compartmentalization. Limit dextrins are then degraded. So limit dextrins, right? So this is after the alpha amylase has gotten a hold of it. They are degraded by the deep branching enzyme. And the deep branching enzyme takes off a tripeptide, not tripeptide, trisaccharide off the end, right? And puts it onto the main chain. So that way alpha amylase can keep going, right? So limit dextrins are degraded by deep branching enzyme. And the catabolic and anabolic enzymes are present in glycogen granules. Glucose one phosphate can be converted to glucose six phosphate by phosphogluco mutase. Because we talked about mutases before, right? They're just moving the phosphate groups around. So in that way, it's more useful for us later. Because glucose six phosphates, what enters glycolysis, right?"

**Q3. Explanation:**

- **Quoted Source**: "So let's look at that and kind of in a little bit better diagram. So this is dietary starch. So the alpha amylase digestion, what that's going to do is leave these highly branched what they call limit dextrins. So highly branched limit dextrins. And you can see they can be very small because if this is a saccharide, right? So my whole body is a saccharide and this guy is the branch. Well, those are all alpha-1-4s, right? So it can chew all the way up to here. This guy can chew all the way up to here so then all guys just with this little branch, right? Makes sense. So all of these little branches are left and then that's called limit dextrins. Okay? All the little pieces that are left after alpha amylase digestion are called limit dextrins. I keep repeating it so that you remember it, limit dextrins. That deep branching enzyme, which is a glucose transferase, well, it has glucose transferase activity. It's going to transfer. So watch this. It's going to transfer a trisaccharide unit from one branch to the end of another. And then we'll talk about why you want to do that in a minute. Can you see that top trisaccharide right up there? I'm going to take that and put it from one branch to the other. Okay, so what did it do? It actually moved it and now made this chain longer again, right? So now the alpha one for amylase can come back through and chew some more. Okay? Does that make sense? So this is kind of a look of our limit dextrins. We've got our glycogen deep branching enzyme. That's the alpha one, six glucose side-aids activity. So it's going to cleave that residue. So see, we ended up with just that one little guy left. Right? He's the only little guy left with the alpha one, six."

- **Quoted Source**: "So let's look at that branching enzyme because now we said we can form the alpha-1-4s, right? So now we're going to have to form the alpha-1-6s. So formation of glycogen branches is catalyzed by the branching enzyme. So it catalyzes them, okay? Six or seven residue segments of a growing glycogen chain are transferred. So as it does with degradation, it's also going to transfer some to make, okay? So we had deep branching, right? Just take some off. We got branching, put some on. Y'all, that should be easy to remember. Deep branching takes off three, right? And then branching puts on six. Easy to remember. Deep branching three, branching six, okay? Six or seven? Six or seven residue segments of a growing glycogen chain are transferred to the C6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue on the same or a nearby chain. So on the top part, you see it on a nearby chain and then the bottom one, you can see it. So we've got the branching enzyme head in there and he's decided to put this guy right here. He transferred seven residue terminal segment to a C6 OH group right there. So a C6, right? Because now we're forming what? What kind of bond? Yes, alpha-1, 6, right? So that's going to be easy to remember with the C6, right? Because we're forming an alpha-1, 6 glycocytic bond for branches. Right? Alpha-1, 6 for glycocytic bonds for branches."

- **Quoted Source**: "So this reaction is known as a phosphorolysis. And this is kind of where the A's part of that comes in before us at A's is usually breaking down or taking off something. Phosphorolysis because we're actually going to break the glycocytic bond by the phosphate, not water. Because normally you're thinking for these, it's hydrolysis, right? But for this one, this is a phosphorolysis. So not hydrolysis. Phosphorolysis, not hydrolysis. I said it a few times underline it. But delta G not prime, did you all discuss delta G not prime? Anybody know what delta G not prime means? It's not what you're going to have. It's a product of the balance of the product of the product of the product of the product. Oh, you are making it hard. You always make everything hard. You were asking questions even on the exam and like you're making things hard. Okay, delta G not prime. Physiological condition. Physiological condition. Physiological condition. Physiological condition. Physiological condition. Yes, there. Yes. Physiological condition. Yes. Physiological condition. Because we can talk about delta G for enzymes and everything else in a simulated environment, right? And that's great. But what's going on in here is completely different. Okay? The delta G not prime might not be like what the measured delta G is. Okay? So delta G not prime is close to zero. So that is at pH, what? 7. 7. Are we at pH 7 inside? 7. No, we're not. We vary. Right? Some of us are at a little bit of a 7.4 depending on where the things are located. It can be a little bit more acidic, right? We vary. Right? So that's a neutral pH. So P at M delta G not prime is whenever you're talking about standard temperatures. Right? We're doing STP at a pH 7. Okay? And people talk about that as being kind of physiological, but it really doesn't match the Envivo. Because Envivo, your pH is going to be different. These are going to be different in vivo. Like I said, it does never really quite match up. Your Envivo is minus 6 kilojoules per row. And that's just because we have a high ratio of inorganic phosphate to glucose 1 phosphate. Okay? So measured temperature, measured delta G is just remember that measured delta G's, even if they're at the end of STPs. They're going to be a little bit different than the Envivo reactions. Because even though that's even close to equilibrium, which is probably still go forward, if it was coupled to something else or had a reaction behind it that was exorganic, this one's minus 6. So it's going to go. So in muscles, what happens to that glucose 6 phosphate? Glucose 6 phosphate, I said we have to make it from glucose 1 to glucose 6 for what? Oh yeah, what patholase is going to enter? We have to have a glucose 6 phosphate, right? Glucose 6 phosphate is going to go into glycolysis. And liver, the glucose 6 phosphate is hydrolyzed to glucose for transport to other tissues. Okay? So in your muscles, these glycogen stores going to be phosphorylated, it's going to undergo a mutated reaction, it's going to go from 1 phosphate to 6 phosphate, it's going to go through glycolysis. And your liver, it's going to do something a little bit different, it's going to be hydrolyzed to glucose for transport to other tissues."

**Q7. Explanation:**
- **Slide**: Lecture 29 Slide 9 - Thus:
- **Correct Answer**: A. And this is what this looks like. Um, they're binding substrate binding. And what does it look like? Well, is it hyperbolic? It's sigmoidal....
- **Quoted Source**: "And this is what this looks like. Um, they're binding substrate binding. And what does it look like? Well, is it hyperbolic? It's sigmoidal. What does that indicate? Cooperativity. Yay. So muscle glycogen phosphorylase shows cooperativity and substrate binding. ATP and glucose 6P are allosteric inhibitors of glycogen phosphorylase. Why is that? Is it because of that ATP? Yeah. If you have ATP, then why do you need it? Right? We're not going to break down something we don't have a need for it. Okay? A-A-M-P is an allosteric activator of glycogen phosphorylase. That makes sense, right? Because A-M-P heavy A-M-P concentrations is going to say, hey, we're low in ATP. When ATP and glucose 6P are abundant, glycogen breakdown is inhibited. When the cellular energy reserves are low, so cellular energy reserves are low, which means that you have low ATP high A-M-P. Then glycogen, catabolism, is stimulated. That makes sense, right? We need to break down our glycogen because we need that energy. Thus, a high energy status, glycogen breakdown is inhibited. We already have tens of ATP. We have precursors. We don't need anything, right? Low energy status. So I haven't eaten a candy bar or anything else all day. I have very low blood sugar, but I'm up walking around and talking, and giving lectures. My muscles, they're like, please eat something. We're wasting. Because then glycogen breakdown is going to be stimulated, right? Because I've got to have it. And why is that? Why do you have to have lots of glucose for? Yes, brain. Right? That brain is busy consuming a lot of glucose. Right? What's the other thing that consumes a lot of glucose? Muscles. If you're going to be integrating your muscles, you're going to need some glucose, right? Just to maintain posture and things like that, you're still burning energy. So to stand perfectly still, if I'm upright, I'm burning energy. Okay?"

- **Quoted Source**: "So now let's talk about glycogen synthesis. Because we just talked about catabolism, right? So now let's talk about enabolism, a biosynthetic pathway. So glycogen synthesis pathway is obviously going to be different from its degradation. Glucose is activated for glycogen synthesis by attachment to urodene diphosphate to form the sugar nuclei tied UDP glucose. We saw that briefly in one of our slides, I didn't get into it too much. But formation of this UDP glucose from glucose 1 phosphate and UTP is actually catalyzed by UDP glucose phosphorylase. That would be the take home from that is that glucose is activated for glycogen synthesis, right? Because we say glucose can go several things, right? So glycogen synthesis is going to be attached to a urodene diphosphate. And it's going to form a different sugar, right? Because now we have a glucose, but it's got an attachment to it. And that sugar is a nucleotide UDP glucose. And then formation of that was catalyzed by UDP glucose phosphorylase."

- **Quoted Source**: "So one of the things that we can look up is I would love to talk about that even maybe online. I might even post a little something about creativity because I think it's very interesting, right? Because we have gotten kind of almost too smart car ourselves. And so sometimes we really try to help our bodies in ways that can be good, but that can also be very detrimental. Okay. So I'll post some creative information on there for you. So here's your sources of energy during your exercise. I have a tendency to get off into anaerobic because I have a tendency to do longer work duration. So during brief intense exercise, so let's say you're doing your like 40s or whatever that they do, right? For football. If you're doing your 100 meter sprints, I did hurdles, 100 meter hurdles. You're doing those things, your energy sources are your free ATP. Okay. So your free ATP, Fosco creatine, because I mean you do have some, right? Obviously that's why we're talking about it. And anaerobic glycolysis. So you can see that all of those things pop off pretty quickly because you see your free ATP. It's the orange line. Do you see what happens in the first couple of seconds? It plummeted to the bottom, right? It took a nose dive. It's gone. Okay. So your initial free ATP is done. We said Fosco creatine will buy you a few more seconds, right? So your Fosco creatine line you're seeing now and it's kind of, well on my screen, it's kind of like a magenta e-color. I don't know what you call it up there. It almost looks red. But you can see the line from Fosco creatine. You're buying yourself a little bit more time, right? But even all of those ATP, that can't go for long because ATP and Fosco creatine are quickly used up. So anything passed really about 30, 40 seconds, you're done with those. Okay? Because then anaerobic glycolysis comes in. And that would cause aidosis. So you can see we have aerobic metabolism, right? We have a lag on that line because we have to build up to that. We have anaerobic metabolism. So back to percentages of total energy. Wait, it's going to drag me nuts. Okay, I think. So what I would want you to know is that your ATP is used up almost within the first couple of seconds. And then you can see that your Fosco creatine, usually about 30 seconds, okay? Pretty much gone by that point. That's what I want you to remember. So longer term exercise, which would be the thousand meter, glycogen breakdown and aerobic metabolism become important. Okay? So in longer term exercise, glycogen breakdown and aerobic metabolism become important. Okay?"

**Q10. Explanation:**
- **Slide**: Lecture 29 Slide 10 - The active fo rm o f the enzyme is designated the R state
- **Correct Answer**: A. The active form of the enzyme, now we're going to go back to something that we've looked at before, is called the R state. That makes sense....
- **Quoted Source**: "The active form of the enzyme, now we're going to go back to something that we've looked at before, is called the R state. That makes sense. You all start building on the stuff we previously learned, right? The R state is what binds things, right? The top states what this. So the R state is usually where you have your active site available, your relaxed state, right? So the active form of the enzyme is in the R state. The inactive form is denoted as the T state, TOT state, TENT state, whatever you want to call it. A and P is going to promote the conversion to the active state. See all of this is just making perfect sense, right? Because this is what you already know. We're just building on what you already know. ATP and glucose 6P and a length of caffeine favor the conversion to the inactive T state. Why caffeine, you may know? Yeah, it's a stimulant that gives energy, right? You break down. So does he even know what caffeine looks like? Yeah. You all seeing it? No. I want nitrogen groups in it. Yes, it helps with walk the face, okay? So as you can hear, some people sometimes say, I'm just running on pure caffeine, right? That can happen. Eventually you'll crash the, so please eat something. So a significant confirmation change occurs at the subunit interface. So we talked about how we have these two towers, right? And we have the two active sites in the middle, right? And all of this stuff right here is forming the interface, right? So if we have this forming the interface and we have something that activates it, right? Or inhibits it either way, that's going to cause a significant conformational change. The conformational change at the interface is linked to a structural change at the active site that's going to affect catalysis. This just reminds me a lot of what? What did we see that upon binding there was a structural change? We saw that as soon as oxygen came, right, it kind of pulled that out, if you look down, right? Same kind of thing, y'all, you already know this, okay? So glycogen metabolism is just a different pathway, but it's using all of the same things that you already know, okay? So a conformational change at the interface is now going to be linked to a structural change at the active site, which affects catalysis."

Oxidative or the end one was the last one we saw. The oxidative decarboxylation. I've seen decarboxylations before. Yes? Yes? Okay. Fospo-gluconate dehydrogenase. We're going to do an oxidative decarboxylation of six phosphogluconate to ribulose-5 phosphate. So our six phosphogluconate, that was our result from this breaking, right? Yes? Blacktown, broke it? Okay? Meow. We're going to do a decarboxylation and we're going to end up with ribulose-5 phosphate. This reaction also generates an NADPH. Okay? The intermediate, while we make an intermediate, we would make an intermediate to facilitate final product formation, right? So this intermediate, three ketose, six PD, gluconate is very susceptible to decarboxylation. Right? So we're just making something again to make the overall reaction more favorable. Okay?"

- **Quoted Source**: "Pinto's phosphate pathway regulation. Now I said that the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase was the rate limiting step for the PPP pathway. Okay, it is the rate controlling step. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is allosterically inhibited by NADPH because there's no reason to turn on the first half of the reactions if we don't need NADPH and intermediates of fatty acid biosynthesis because we're using NADPH to make fatty acids. Okay, this and other regulatory mechanisms help partition glucose between glycolysis and the Pinto's phosphate pathway. Okay, so we're able to regulate between glycolysis and the Pinto's phosphate pathway. Okay, and again, according to cell requirements. If you suddenly need ATP, it's not going to go through all the way through the Pinto's phosphate pathway. It would kick it out at that point and go to you, glycolysis. Right?"

- **Quoted Source**: "But look here, here's our transalvalase. Step seven, transalvalase. The transalvalase reaction now is going to transfer three carbon units. So step six, we move two, and hand TPP is a co-inzyme. Step seven, we're gonna move three. And what are we gonna make? It's still gonna add up to 10, y'all. Still gonna add up to 10. So if you remove three, then you're gonna have a four and a six. Okay, so we took three off of that seven, because he had the most to get, right? So that Ceto-Hatchalo seven P, we're gonna take three off of him, add him to glycerol to hide three phosphate, and end up with a Ritro-Spor phosphate, which is useful because we're gonna make our aromatic amino acids, and we're gonna end up with fructose six phosphate, and fructose six phosphate, as we say, can go wherever we want it to go, right? Glicoluses, go-go-mune genesis, whatever the cell needs, right? Based on the cell state, then it will decide where these other things are gonna go. Okay? So transalvalase, we're gonna take three carbon unit, we're gonna generate four and six. Okay?"

Well guess what? Zylulose 5-bossate thinks same thing. Because all three of these molecules are in equilibrium. So we can just shuttle back and forth. So the three pentas-bossates are in equilibrium. Step 4, I said was an isomerization, right? And step 5 is that epimerization. We're just exchanging groups on a single carbon."

- **Quoted Source**: "So, reactions 4 through 8, here's the non-oxidatives. These steps of the pathway produce ribose 5-phosphate for nucleic acids and co-inzyme biosynthesis. So we can make nucleic acids and co-inzyme biosynthesis via ribose 5-phosphate. Now, what does it make? NAD, AH, NADPH, FAD. We'll talk more about FAD later. We'll see it as we're starting to get into electron transport chain. Okay? Some of this carbon is directed to glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. Right? Both of these can go into glycolysis. Yes? Can both of them go into gluconeogenesis? Yes. Huh? Yes. Okay? So, the second phase of the pathway is non-oxidative synthesis of five carbon sugars. Depending on the body state, ribose 5-phosphate, again, can reversibly isomerize to ribose 5-phosphate. So this step 4 reaction that we have here, it can go back and forth between ribose 5-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate. Okay? Reversibly isomerize, ribose 5-phosphate can alternatively, again, undergoes a series of what we said can go undergo a series of trans-alylations, trans-ketalations, and that we're going to produce other pentose phosphates, including fructose 6-phosphate, arithro-spoor phosphate, glycerolidolide 3-phosphate, and again, these are all useful for either biosynthetic reactions or to go back into glycolysis. Like, we voice nothing, right? Something's going to each pathways. Okay?"

**Q8. Explanation:**
- **Slide**: Lecture 30 Slide 3 - NADPH + H* NADPH + H™
- **Correct Answer**: A. Now here's a look at the pentos phosphate pathway. I know it looks a little daunting right now. We're going to break it up into its bits. Ok...
- **Quoted Source**: "Now here's a look at the pentos phosphate pathway. I know it looks a little daunting right now. We're going to break it up into its bits. Okay, so we said that basically there's two distinct phases, phase one and phase two. Okay, phase one you're actually going to see up there in like the nasty like yellowy whatever color block, right? So we can see that that is the oxidative phase. Remember I said it's going to happen in three steps as the oxidative phase and then below right down here is the non-reducing phase or the non-oxidative phase, non-reducing, non-oxidative phases. All right, oxidative phase. Let's talk about it first. We're starting with glucose phosphate. Remember we said that guy he can go to lots of different places. Glucose six phosphate was actually in glycolysis, right? What was the first step? Glucose. Second thing was what? Also glucose in the phase. Yeah, but we turned it into what? We phosphorylated on where? Six. Six, right? And then we moved it to three, right? So we could go through. Yes? But if you phosphorylate on six, we can just go this direction. So remember I said we can use this guy for other things. So top part, oxidative reactions. So phase one, bottom part, non-oxidative reactions, phase two. The oxidative phase is where we're going to take that glucose six phosphate and convert it to regular five phosphate. Okay? Now you can see just from looking up here, those two conversions that we're doing to get there, they're going to generate what at the top? NADPH, right? So we're actually going to generate those NADPHs we need for those biosynthetic reactions. Okay? During the process, we said that two molecules of NADP plus are now going to be reduced to NADPH The second phase of the pathway is the non-oxidative synthesis and we're going to synthesize five. Well, really, we're just going to synthesize a whole bunch of pentoses. Pentoses are five carbon, right? Just five carbons, five carbon molecules, pentoses. Okay? So we're going to we're going to make pentoses now. The second phase, non-oxidative, five carbon sugars, depending on the body's state, I cannot say that enough. Depending on the body's state, it's going to decide where these are going to go. Just like Haram always telling you all that ATP will, allosterically inhibit something or AMP will allosterically affect something or acetyl CoA will allosterically affect something, right? Your body knows what it needs. Okay? And so depending on what your metabolic needs are at that moment, it will make a decision. Okay? So depending on the body's state, the ribulose five phosphate that you've got here at the end of the oxidative steps, right? At the end of phase one, that ribulose five phosphate can actually reversibly asomerize back to ribulose five phosphate. It can alternatively, it can alternatively undergo a series of isomerizations, which is what you're seeing down here, as well as trans-aldelations, trans-ketalations. So we're just kind of moving things around. And what that's going to do is it's going to result in the production of other pentose phosphates, including fructose six phosphate. Now we've talked about fructose six phosphate before as well, right? Okay? So it can make fructose six phosphate. It can also make a rhithro-sfour phosphate. So fructose six phosphate, these can actually go back into glycolysis. We can also end up with Guisaraldehyde three phosphate, which can also go back to glycolysis. We can end up with a rhithro-sfour phosphate. A rhithro-sfour phosphate is very interesting because it's an intermediate that's essential for something. A rhithro-sfour phosphate is essential for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids. So what are your aromatic amino acids? Tarrasein, tryptophan, phenylalanine. Okay? Those are your aromatics. So you have to have a rhithro-sfour phosphate in order to make aromatic amino acids. All of these compounds on the bottom half, they can be used in a variety of different biological processes, including the production of nucleotides, nucleic acids with the ribose-five phosphate. Okay? So that first one right here. So at the end of phase one, we have regular five phosphate, right? So we have ribose-five phosphate. That guy can give rise to nucleotides, okay? Or nucleic acids. We can end up with a rhithro-sfour phosphate. That gives rise to aromatic amino acids, right? So anything that you're looking at kind of springed, yes? As well as synthesis of aromatics, nucleics, nucleotides, all kinds of other biosynthetic, and even some glycolytic precursors to go back into glycolysis, okay? Why would we want to make these down here any ideas? Why you would want to make something to go to glycolysis if you're doing the Pinto-sphosphate pathway? Would you want to be able to? Do your cellular needs not change on a dime? All right. Can you not have some thing that you need to respond to quickly? Yes? Right? So it's always nice to be able to have the option if you're in a pathway to speed off to a different one, okay?"

- **Quoted Source**: "Now step five, phosphopintose epimerase. You all remember what an epimer is, right? We're just changing around what? One carbon, right? What is a diastereoirisomer? We're changing around what? Two or more, right? So this is an epimerase. We're making an epimer, okay? The phosphopintose epimerase reaction is actually going to enter convert Robulus 5-phosphate and Zalulose 5-phosphate. The mechanism, guess what? It involves an endodial intermediate. Any inversion, though, is at the C3. Remember we said we're just going to change one thing? The inversion is at the C3, so we just turn the C3, okay?"

- **Quoted Source**: "Step 8, we're actually going to move another two. This is why I don't want you all to get confused, right? So it's another transketalase. We're going to take a two carbon transfer. This is catalyzed with transketalase. And guess what? Transketalase is required, TPP, as a co-inzyme. It's no different than the first transketalase reaction. Okay? The products here are going to be fruitosex phosphate, and glycerol to high three phosphate, which both can enter glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. Okay? So, step 6, two carbon, step 7, three carbon, step 8, two carbon. Okay? So you might want to write them down and know where your things are moving, right? Why are we doing all of this moving around? It seems like a waste, right? But it's not. It's always so that we can make things that will go other places if we need to. Okay?"
