    "transcription": "================================================================================\n\nIt's a metabolism. So let's look at the degradation. So starch and glycogen degradation, we obtain our glucose from storage or from diet, right? Predominantly, you want to eat it. And that's just because that's how we like to uptake our nutrients as we do it by consuming. Now, in the event that you have a very restrictive diet, which we've talked about, if you have a very restrictive diet, then you start breaking down. And so then you can do that from your storage. So this was a test question, AFA AMALE, it's an endoglycosides. That is found in your saliva, right? So in the minute you start eating and it's breaking down, it's also found in your pancreatic secretions. And that's responsible for hydrolyzing the alpha-1-4 linkage. Right, so this is just a repeat of what we've seen before. It cleaves dietary amylopectin or glycogen to maltose. So that's something that we didn't look at was what it cleaved it to. So we know that AFA-1-4 linkage is a broken. We now have maltose, which is a disaccharide. Disaccharide means two saccharides, right? A maltotrioce, which is a trisaccharide and other small oligosaccharides. This is the interesting thing about AFA AMALE. It's active on either side of the branch point, but the activity is reduced near the branch point. Okay, so if I am an amylopectin, okay, so I'm a starch and I have this branch over here and this branch over here. What will happen is we have all of these little alpha-1-4s, right? So I've got all of these little saccharides in here. It's gonna come in and it's gonna take off just some towards the end, okay? And it's gonna take off more. It's gonna take off more. But as it gets closer to here to the actual branch point, something else steps in because it's not as functional but closer it's the branch. Okay, back when the other enzyme comes in. And the other enzyme is what I've always been calling over our last couple of lectures, the debranching enzyme. That's the easy way for me to remember it is the debranching enzyme. And that is it cleaves limit dextrins. Limit dextrins means you're just getting close to the end. The two activities of the debranching enzyme, it transfers trisaccharide groups and cleaves the remaining single glucose units from the main chains. So the interesting thing about the debranching enzyme is an or to make branches what kind of glycocytic bond is right here? Alpha-1-6, right? We just said amylase doesn't two alpha-1-6, right? Only hydrolysis the alpha-1-4s. So it'll do the alpha-1-4s until it gets the kind of close to the branch. And then the alpha-1-6 will come in, okay? Natural debranching enzyme. So the first thing we're going to do is to make sure that the is the right amount of the blood. So the first thing we're going to do is to make sure that the is the right amount of the blood. So the first thing we're going to do is to make sure that the is the right amount of the blood. So the first thing we're going to do is to make sure that the is the right amount of the blood.

    "transcription": "================================================================================\n\nSo let's look at that and kind of in a little bit better diagram. So this is dietary starch. So the alpha amylase digestion, what that's going to do is leave these highly branched what they call limit dextrins. So highly branched limit dextrins. And you can see they can be very small because if this is a saccharide, right? So my whole body is a saccharide and this guy is the branch. Well, those are all alpha-1-4s, right? So it can chew all the way up to here. This guy can chew all the way up to here so then all guys just with this little branch, right? Makes sense. So all of these little branches are left and then that's called limit dextrins. Okay? All the little pieces that are left after alpha amylase digestion are called limit dextrins. I keep repeating it so that you remember it, limit dextrins. That deep branching enzyme, which is a glucose transferase, well, it has glucose transferase activity. It's going to transfer. So watch this. It's going to transfer a trisaccharide unit from one branch to the end of another. And then we'll talk about why you want to do that in a minute. Can you see that top trisaccharide right up there? I'm going to take that and put it from one branch to the other. Okay, so what did it do? It actually moved it and now made this chain longer again, right? So now the alpha one for amylase can come back through and chew some more. Okay? Does that make sense? So this is kind of a look of our limit dextrins. We've got our glycogen deep branching enzyme. That's the alpha one, six glucose side-aids activity. So it's going to cleave that residue. So see, we ended up with just that one little guy left. Right? He's the only little guy left with the alpha one, six.\n\n\n================================================================================"

So digestive breakdown of starch and dietary glycogen. Now this is going to go against what you would think. So please note it. Digestive breakdown of starch and dietary glycogen is unregulated. That goes against the grain because we've been talking about everything of being about catabolism and all of that stuff being very heavily regulated. But digestive breakdown is not okay. Unregulated. Nearly 100% of your ingested food is absorbed and metabolized. Tissue glycogen is an important energy reservoir and the synthesis and degradation of storage glycogen is instead tightly regulated. Right? So once we've actually done our dietary job, right, we've broken it all down 100% efficient, some of the gas stored somewhere or some of it whatever. But that once it's been stored that way down is very high-level. But not what you're ingesting, not the digestive breakdown. Glacogen consists of granules of homolecular weight.

So we've consumed it, right? It's 100%. Inception, we broke it all down. I'm regulated. Digestion. And now we've stored things away. So we had stored our glycogen stores. Glycogen phosphorylase. So phosphorylase, right? We're going to remove a phosphate group. That's what it sounds like, right? So glycogen phosphorylase cleaves one sugar unit from the end of a glycogen chain, one sugar unit. So we saw where we could take off three, right? That the branching enzyme took off three. This guy's going to only take off one from the end of a glycogen chain and uses inorganic phosphate. We're actually going to phosphorylate here. We're going to use an inorganic phosphate to phosphorylate the glucose. Usually when you think of phosphorylating, you're thinking of kinases, activities, right? Whereas usually the other aizes are you're taking off. This one we're actually going to use inorganic phosphate to phosphorylate the glucose. And we phosphorylate glucose for what reasons? This avoids use of ATP to phosphorylate glucose is one thing. That's why we're using the inorganic phosphate. We don't want to use any energy for this. But we're not going to waste an ATP on it. We're just going to use an inorganic phosphate for that. So that's good. So we've avoided the use of ATP to phosphorylate this glucose. But we phosphorylate glucose, right, for all of the other things that needs to do, right? We go through glycogen all of these other things. What's in phosphorylate? Plus it keeps it where it's supposed to be. Remember compartmentalization. Limit dextrins are then degraded. So limit dextrins, right? So this is after the alpha amylase has gotten a hold of it. They are degraded by the deep branching enzyme. And the deep branching enzyme takes off a tripeptide, not tripeptide, trisaccharide off the end, right? And puts it onto the main chain. So that way alpha amylase can keep going, right? So limit dextrins are degraded by deep branching enzyme. And the catabolic and anabolic enzymes are present in glycogen granules. Glucose one phosphate can be converted to glucose six phosphate by phosphogluco mutase. Because we talked about mutases before, right? They're just moving the phosphate groups around. So in that way, it's more useful for us later. Because glucose six phosphates, what enters glycolysis, right?\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "transcription": "================================================================================\n\nSo this reaction is known as a phosphorolysis. And this is kind of where the A's part of that comes in before us at A's is usually breaking down or taking off something. Phosphorolysis because we're actually going to break the glycocytic bond by the phosphate, not water. Because normally you're thinking for these, it's hydrolysis, right? But for this one, this is a phosphorolysis. So not hydrolysis. Phosphorolysis, not hydrolysis. I said it a few times underline it. But delta G not prime, did you all discuss delta G not prime? Anybody know what delta G not prime means? It's not what you're going to have. It's a product of the balance of the product of the product of the product of the product. Oh, you are making it hard. You always make everything hard. You were asking questions even on the exam and like you're making things hard. Okay, delta G not prime. Physiological condition. Physiological condition. Physiological condition. Physiological condition. Physiological condition. Yes, there. Yes. Physiological condition. Yes. Physiological condition. Because we can talk about delta G for enzymes and everything else in a simulated environment, right? And that's great. But what's going on in here is completely different. Okay? The delta G not prime might not be like what the measured delta G is. Okay? So delta G not prime is close to zero. So that is at pH, what? 7. 7. Are we at pH 7 inside? 7. No, we're not. We vary. Right? Some of us are at a little bit of a 7.4 depending on where the things are located. It can be a little bit more acidic, right? We vary. Right? So that's a neutral pH. So P at M delta G not prime is whenever you're talking about standard temperatures. Right? We're doing STP at a pH 7. Okay? And people talk about that as being kind of physiological, but it really doesn't match the Envivo. Because Envivo, your pH is going to be different. These are going to be different in vivo. Like I said, it does never really quite match up. Your Envivo is minus 6 kilojoules per row. And that's just because we have a high ratio of inorganic phosphate to glucose 1 phosphate. Okay? So measured temperature, measured delta G is just remember that measured delta G's, even if they're at the end of STPs. They're going to be a little bit different than the Envivo reactions. Because even though that's even close to equilibrium, which is probably still go forward, if it was coupled to something else or had a reaction behind it that was exorganic, this one's minus 6. So it's going to go. So in muscles, what happens to that glucose 6 phosphate? Glucose 6 phosphate, I said we have to make it from glucose 1 to glucose 6 for what? Oh yeah, what patholase is going to enter? We have to have a glucose 6 phosphate, right? Glucose 6 phosphate is going to go into glycolysis. And liver, the glucose 6 phosphate is hydrolyzed to glucose for transport to other tissues. Okay? So in your muscles, these glycogen stores going to be phosphorylated, it's going to undergo a mutated reaction, it's going to go from 1 phosphate to 6 phosphate, it's going to go through glycolysis. And your liver, it's going to do something a little bit different, it's going to be hydrolyzed to glucose for transport to other tissues.\n\n\n================================================================================"

This is a different reference notation. Okay? So we've got alpha helices. The beta sheets still look like what you're used to seeing. And then we've got some loops here. You can see that we have, oh, looky there. We have AMP as an alistairic effector. We also have what's known as a tower helix. And it is actually going to play a role. So we see that helix is kind of sticking straight out the top. That's called the tower helix. We also have our glycogen binding site there in yellow, our paradoxal p at the catalytic site.

We're not going to break down something we don't have a need for it. Okay? A-A-M-P is an allosteric activator of glycogen phosphorylase. That makes sense, right? Because A-M-P heavy A-M-P concentrations is going to say, hey, we're low in ATP. When ATP and glucose 6P are abundant, glycogen breakdown is inhibited. When the cellular energy reserves are low, so cellular energy reserves are low, which means that you have low ATP high A-M-P. Then glycogen, catabolism, is stimulated. That makes sense, right?

So the R state is usually where you have your active site available, your relaxed state, right? So the active form of the enzyme is in the R state. The inactive form is denoted as the T state, TOT state, TENT state, whatever you want to call it. A and P is going to promote the conversion to the active state. See all of this is just making perfect sense, right? Because this is what you already know. We're just building on what you already know. ATP and glucose 6P and a length of caffeine favor the conversion to the inactive T state. Why caffeine, you may know? Yeah, it's a stimulant that gives energy, right? You break down.

So in this case, kind of exactly, if we Foss-for-relate this, then we're kind of turning it more on. Okay? So we're going to make it more on. Foss-for-relation causes a large conformational change and converts the enzyme to a form in which it's much less sensitive to allosteric regulation. Okay? So this is just another level of regulation here, because we can Foss-for-relate it, and now that makes it less sensitive to whether or not there's ATP or whatever else present, right? Because we've already caused a conformational change that would probably overshadow whatever else would happen if there's an allosteric around. Okay? The A form is less sensitive to allosteric regulation than the B form. Well, that makes sense because the A form we just converted to, and that was the more active form, right?

So phosphorylation reduces the value. This is where we're going back to our models. Phosphorylation reduces the value of L, the taut over the relaxed form in the MWC model. So the equilibrium between the taut and the relaxed forms in the MWC model reduces the value of it.\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "transcription": "================================================================================\n\nThat's not the important part. What I want you to know is how to regulate. Okay. So, let's look at this, glycogen phosphorylase. As I said, kinases are responsible for a lot of our regulations. So this is a cascade regulation via kinases. So the phosphorylase kinase, that phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase, is itself regulated by phosphorylation, right? So don't let that trip you out. But yes, not only can the enzyme that's doing the regulation, phosphorylate, but it also can be phosphorylated to turn off. Okay. And a lot of that, you'll see a lot of that is going through your classes because a lot of extracellular signals come in, and it kicks off this cascade of all of these phosphorylation events, but turns on certain enzymes whenever a stimulus is received. Okay. So we see in this case, right? A hormone. We've got epinephrine, adrenaline, some glucogon, whatever. So a hormone, we have inactive, anylcyclase, you know what that is, right? No. See me know what anylcyclase is. It makes sickle-cane. It does go to that, yes. Oh, that's, that's going to be a Google question. I'm going to have y'all Google that. So glucogon is made in response to low blood sugar, okay? And that stimulates mobilization of glycogen. So if you have glucogon, which was on one of your last slides, right? So glucogon, right? It's since a signal, we've got cyclic AMP, right? The neck's signal, since a signal. And the adrenaline prepares the organism for mobilization of large amounts of energy could be fight of light, right? And the event that's epinephrine, right? So we have the hormone signaling. It's going to signal inactive, anylcyclase, it's going to become active. That's going to signal camp cyclic AMP. So we're going to have ATP with that. And then we're going to have inactive camp dependent protein kinase is now going to be phosphorylated to be active camp dependent protein kinase. So all of these things are getting phosphorylated through all these steps, okay? Then we're going to take that active camp dependent protein kinase and we're going to phosphorylate again, okay? So we can see that we can change states via the phosphorylation of our phosphorylase kinase, right? We can turn it on or off. Same thing for our glycogen phosphorylase B, it can be on or off, depending on its phosphorylation. The glucogon secretion is inhibited by insulin. Do you all remember that flag and showed insulin? Insulin is going to inhibit glucogon secretion and diabetics, though, because we have talked about diabetes, Melodis, right? And diabetics glycogen is degraded even when glucose is high. Okay? So glycogen is degraded even when glucose is high.\n\n\n================================================================================"

Camp is a second messenger. Okay, so under, underline it. Cyclic AMP is a second messenger, because what is a second messenger do? It transduces the message of the hormone.

AdNil cyclase is membrane associated. Because how else are you going to get the signal from the outside, right? So AdNil cyclase is membrane associated. And this mechanism, as you can see, we've got the hormone coming in. We have a hormone receptor. Yes, you have them, right? We have hormone receptors there. They're associated with G proteins. We have AdNil cyclase over there. And kind of a... Oh no. A terrible,ish colored pinkish tube, right? Looks like salmon. I don't like the color salmon. But it's over there. It looks like a little tube, right? So what happens upon signaling with the hormone, as you can see, and beat in the little second section here, is we start beating this signal, right? So now the gamma and beta of the G proteins, those seven minutes have moved over. We've got alpha, has been freed alpha GTP. As we've undergo some GTP hydrolysis, just you know? And we end up with a camp signal. So ATP camp. We slow the GTP as activity. As the alpha hydrolyzes GTP to GTP, so that's getting back off of there. Okay? And then we see this guy right down here. We still have the signal, right? Everything still looks the same at that point. But the G alpha GTP is going to disassociate from the AdNil cyclase and return back to that guy. Okay? So it's ready for the next signal. That was all it had to do. It's just go over there and tell us guys something. Okay? And then once it's gone back, then it's an active. So this is the activation of AdNil cyclase right over here. Okay? So this mechanism amplifies the signal because one hormone receptor complex can activate mini G proteins. And mini camp molecules can be synthesized before the G protein disassociates. So you see how it's making all of these camp molecules? Mini can be made before that alpha GTP disassociates. Okay? So of course, if one little signal can give us lots of signal, then that's obviously amplification, right? Something weaker gave us a lot. So that's how we're amplifying this signal and that's how this functions as a secondary messenger.\n\n\n================================================================================"

But formation of this UDP glucose from glucose 1 phosphate and UTP is actually catalyzed by UDP glucose phosphorylase. That would be the take home from that is that glucose is activated for glycogen synthesis, right? Because we say glucose can go several things, right? So glycogen synthesis is going to be attached to a urodene diphosphate. And it's going to form a different sugar, right? Because now we have a glucose, but it's got an attachment to it.

Okay, so allosterically activated by high concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate because we have a lot it's needed to store some. Okay, so we're going to make some glycogen. Okay, at least nine serine residues are phosphorylated. So that's a lot, right? So we only phosphorylated what in the other one? What? Serine? What serine, right? Serine what? Serine 14. It's only one serine to control the phosphorylase activity. But for synthase we are going to actually phosphorylate nine residues. Nine serine residues are phosphorylated and four different protein kinases are involved. So a lot more heavily regulated maybe on the making, right? Dephosphorylation is carried out by phosphoprotein phosphatase 1. We actually saw that one of our last slides of gluconeogenesis. So dephosphorylation is carried out by phosphoprotein phosphatase 1. PP1 which is probably how you'll hear me call it, in activates glycogen phosphorylase and activates glycogen synthase. So this guy does both, okay? He inactivates glycogen phosphorylase and activates glycogen synthase. Heads up for my class. Your, we call those problem sets, I made it. Guess what's on it? This, okay? Pretty much a lot of what we've been talking about today. Okay, I'm a pathways person and I'm definitely a phosphorylate person, okay? So a lot of mine is regulation. All of my stuff, you all should be able to Google, find it in your book or find it even on your slides because some of it is literally from that. Okay, so this problem set should not take you long to do and I expect you to do it well and get a turn in, okay? That being said, yes, you can go to workshop because they will work through the pathways for you. Okay, defosphorylated enzyme here has a high activity and does not require glucose six phosphate for activity. So see, again, phosphorylating, actually, defosphorylating that guy, we phosphorylated the other guy, defosphorylated this guy, defosphorylated enzyme has a high activity and does not require glucose six phosphate for activity. Phosphorylation has an opposite effect, right? Because one, you phosphorylate it to make it just constitutively active. Okay, this guy, you defosphorylate it, it's pretty much constitutively active.

I know y'all are tired. So that would be why you would have those receptors there. So, in the liver and the muscles, triggers protein kinase castates. We've talked about protein kinase castates. That's stimuli glycogen synthesis. All right. Insulin's effect includes stimulation of lipid synthesis. What it knows what a lipid is. Glicogen synthesis, protein synthesis, glycolysis, and active transport. And at the same time that it's stimulating all of these, it has to turn off the other side, right? So we have reciprocal regulation again. Something's going up. Something's going down. So what's going down? What's getting inhibited is gluconeogenesis. We certainly don't want to do that. We don't want to make more blood glucose when we're trying to store it. And lipid breakdown, right? Because we're actually making lipids. We just said lipid synthesis.

So glycogen synthase is allosterically activated by glucose 6p, right? And just glucose, right? And glucose 6p is what? We just talked about how glucose comes into all of this, right? It's phosphorylated, right? We talked about phosphorylation. We even said it gets phosphorylated on what spot. And then it gets moved to what spot. You all are like, I don't remember that. That was Wednesday. Okay. It gets phosphorylated on what spot? And then it goes through a mutated reaction, which moves it to what spot? Oh, there we go. They're alive. They're alive. Oh, y'all, check your pulse. All right. So let's look at this guy. Okay. We've got an insulin receptor. We see some insulin there. Okay. Does anybody know what this little squiggly, worm-looking thing is over there? Well, that's got that bound to that. I'm talking about in the plasma membrane. Anybody know what that is? What is it? A G-C-P-R. Tell them what that is. There's seven philates that have a G-D-P-P-P-P to connect with the plant. They have a cascade. Did everybody hear that? Hina? Say it now, William. This is a seven helix protein that have G-D-K-F-F-B-D-W. I think it was attached to the C-C-P-P-P. Then that would initiate a second lesson here. We have a cascade reaction. This is a seven transmembrane protein. Okay. It just spans the membrane seven times. They are called G-P-C-Rs. That stands for G-proteined coupled receptor. Okay. G-P-C-R stands for G-proteined coupled receptors. Okay. They are responsible for a lot of signal cascades. We can see here. We see some glucose outside of the plasma membrane. It says, oh, there's glucose. What is that doing? That's telling. Actually, what we're having here is we've got insulin. We're never mind our glucose. We've got our insulin, our insulin receptor. It's touching. You see it up there? It's touching. We're sending signals. We've got a protein kind of cascade going in two different directions. We can go this way because we said we have to do what? We have to turn stuff on. We have to turn stuff off. Right? That's going on to simulate glycogen synthesis, lipid synthesis, protein synthesis, all of these synthesizing reactions. We're turning off everything that's going to break down stuff. Okay. So we're going to have all of these different cascade going off. We can see that we're turning things on. We see that guy that we said we had to have a lymphosporylate. Remember, there's one of them that has how many sites for phosphorylation. It has a certain number of serings. How many? I thought y'all might remember that one guy that had serine 14, but no, not. That's what that little guy is with all those little phosphorylation sites sticking out of him. That's not nine, but that's okay. So this is just a little diagram of some of the things that go on. Blue four, that's in response to your glucose. And so we can see that we're going through allosteric activation. And we're still turning on glycogen synthase. Okay. And that's just because there's glucose out there. We say glucose is an allosteric acovena. Right? Glucose and glucose 6p.\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "transcription": "================================================================================\n\nAll right, let's talk about glucon and epinephrine. Right? So, we have a weird looking diagram. Okay? This is basically just telling you the feedbacks. So do not get freaked out by all of these errors. Okay? So we said that we have glucose and ATP, right? What's that gonna signal? Tethesis, right? Then we're gonna signal synthesis. That's what we've been talking about. And so we're gonna go through glucose six phosphate, glucose one phosphate, and ATP glucose glycogen synthesis. We're gonna go to glycogen. We're gonna go to glycogen phosphorylase. That would be glycolic acid if you're going that way. So, to make glycogen on this, right? We can see that glucose six phosphate, all they're saying on this little thing is that glucose six phosphate is a positive or an activator, a positive, allocereic activator, right? So what's the inhibitor? Right? So we have, yeah, we've got an epinephrine actually inhibits the synthase, but we've also got low blood sugar. Then we've got this guy over here. We've got ATP glucose six phosphate. They're negative inhibitors for glycolic acid. We've got AMP. That's a positive inhibitor, right? Cause we need to work it down in the ATP. All I want you to know, y'all, is really kind of what we've already said on that previous slide. We're all listed out. Just know who is the positive activator. Who's the negative activator? What hormones are affecting what? Okay? Cause to me, this almost gets like confusing, right? I like myself drawing on a straight line. So just keep in mind that we do not need to make ATP if we have it, right? That's what I tell you all the time. Why extend energy to make ATP if you have ATP pressed? So of course, ATP is in a inhibit glycolicis. Okay? Who would go six phosphate? That is also part of the glycolidic pathway. If it's also heading in its presence, then it's also going to inhibit that. Okay? Cause then you are in what we call energy, our high energy conditions, right? Remember, we call them high energy conditions. Okay? Now, if you have a large concentration of inorganic phosphate, remember that's PI plus AMP, then what does that tell you? Yes, you're at a low energy state, right? So you have a lot of AMP concentration, you're at a low energy state. Okay, well now we gotta turn that thing on. We've gotta break down our glycogen and undergo glycolicis. Okay, so that's really what this is telling you. Is this the difference between a high energy and low energy state? Okay? And then down here, you can see that the red arrows are our allosteric regulation, which we did talk about glucose, this six phosphate and an allosteric activator. And then on this side, it's an allosteric inhibitor, right? ATP, obviously, and allosteric inhibitor. And then AMP, we've talked about that in the past being an allosteric activator. So that's just telling you what the red and blue arrows are, y'all are welcome to those three of those.\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "transcription": "================================================================================\n\nbecause I really want to get to phosphocreatine. Okay? I know that lots of people love creatine, right? So let's talk about creatine. Phosphocreatine. What is it? It is a phosphorylated creatine molecule that serves as a rapidly mobilizable reserve of high-energy phosphates. Why do we care? Here's why. It provides short-term sources of ATP and muscles and brains. Just so you know, most people aren't using it for the muscles. I mean, the brains, they're using it for muscles, right? So when you hear people talking about taking creatine or adding creatine to that, they're usually doing some kind of muscle building, right? Gentlemen, yes? Some ways. So it provides a short-term source of ATP and muscles and the brain because it can phosphorylate ADP to make ATP. That's the take-home, right there. Phosphocreatine can phosphorylate ADP to make ATP. So you can do that rapidly, right? We can phosphorylate directly ADP to make ATP and that is called wood. So it's up straight level. Yes! Oh, look at y'all. Substrate-level phosphorylation. We had a substrate plus ADP yields ATP. Okay? So that is substrate-level phosphorylation. So if I ask you about the phosphocreatine reaction to generate ATP, that is a phosph- that is that, okay? So that is substrate-level phosphorylation. Dietary supplementation with creatine. It does increase your muscle store of phosphocreatine and it can improve your performance, but it's only brief. Okay? It says, but FDA recommends doctors approval. I have actually seen people take too much creatine. Does that have a deleterious effect? Yes. Okay? You can't actually overdo it pretty much on everything, right? I have a brother, a step-brother that was very into his physique. And he took a lot of creatine and he took a lot of vitamins. And then he made himself sick. Because believe it or not, you can actually poison yourself with vitamins as well. Okay? So everything in moderation, right? And then make sure if you're going to start really pumping up for something that you're getting with your doctor or taking too much creatine, okay? During intense exercise, that free ATP, though. We said it makes it fast, but it depletes it fast. So it's going to be depleted within seconds. Normally, right? Free ATP is depleted within seconds. Fostocreatine, though, prolongs ATP availability for a few more seconds because you can substrate level phosphorylation, right? So you can kind of rapidly kind of help your ATP source. That being said, ATP is used quickly. So even that would give you only a few more seconds, right? So you're going to kind of breathe. So if you only use this for a deadlift thing, there's one thing. Yeah. I mean, here's the thing. If you use it all the time, I guess, and you're lifting, then yeah, it helps, right? Because once you've built up the mass, it's not going to go away just because your creatine levels are down, right? Because that's not what's actually doing the bustle building. It's just giving me the energy to do it, right? Yeah, you can do it for that. You can do it for running or whatever else. It can be all kinds of little endurance bumps, okay? But usually you see people doing it for weights. Yes? What would be the effect of creating a symptom? Like, what would it be? Water? Water? That's probably one. There's a lot of things that cause water retention. And usually when you're trying to bulk up and be all, you know, what's that? The last thing you want is a lot of water retention. That's probably one. And that's usually because whenever you guys get ready to do competitions and things like that, they usually cutting water. You certainly don't want that. Cutting water is another problem, right? So, um, I actually have a female bodybuilder friend. And every time she does that, I get a little bit sad. I get scared for you. So, yes, I see a couple of guys laughing, but no, that really worries me. Ah.\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "transcription": "================================================================================\n\nSo one of the things that we can look up is I would love to talk about that even maybe online. I might even post a little something about creativity because I think it's very interesting, right? Because we have gotten kind of almost too smart car ourselves. And so sometimes we really try to help our bodies in ways that can be good, but that can also be very detrimental. Okay. So I'll post some creative information on there for you. So here's your sources of energy during your exercise. I have a tendency to get off into anaerobic because I have a tendency to do longer work duration. So during brief intense exercise, so let's say you're doing your like 40s or whatever that they do, right? For football. If you're doing your 100 meter sprints, I did hurdles, 100 meter hurdles. You're doing those things, your energy sources are your free ATP. Okay. So your free ATP, Fosco creatine, because I mean you do have some, right? Obviously that's why we're talking about it. And anaerobic glycolysis. So you can see that all of those things pop off pretty quickly because you see your free ATP. It's the orange line. Do you see what happens in the first couple of seconds? It plummeted to the bottom, right? It took a nose dive. It's gone. Okay. So your initial free ATP is done. We said Fosco creatine will buy you a few more seconds, right? So your Fosco creatine line you're seeing now and it's kind of, well on my screen, it's kind of like a magenta e-color. I don't know what you call it up there. It almost looks red. But you can see the line from Fosco creatine. You're buying yourself a little bit more time, right? But even all of those ATP, that can't go for long because ATP and Fosco creatine are quickly used up. So anything passed really about 30, 40 seconds, you're done with those. Okay? Because then anaerobic glycolysis comes in. And that would cause aidosis. So you can see we have aerobic metabolism, right? We have a lag on that line because we have to build up to that. We have anaerobic metabolism. So back to percentages of total energy. Wait, it's going to drag me nuts. Okay, I think. So what I would want you to know is that your ATP is used up almost within the first couple of seconds. And then you can see that your Fosco creatine, usually about 30 seconds, okay? Pretty much gone by that point. That's what I want you to remember. So longer term exercise, which would be the thousand meter, glycogen breakdown and aerobic metabolism become important. Okay? So in longer term exercise, glycogen breakdown and aerobic metabolism become important. Okay?\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "transcription": "================================================================================\n\nSo this is kind of a look at the degradation of glycogen stores during your exercise and of course you can see in light exercise you don't even really get into them right? If you're just lightly exercising your glycogen doesn't have to come from your liver and your muscles that you know you can just probably use up your free ATP you do have some blood sugar you have other things going on for you there so you don't really have to tap into your reserves. For moderate exercise you can see that probably about 15 minutes kind of starting to get into them right by 120 minutes which just seems like a long time but 120 minutes that's two hours right of moderate exercise then you're down into your glycogen content look at it it's almost nothing right and this is where training and things like that really come into play to kind of help with your aerobic metabolism and things like that because of course you're not going to finish a half marathon or a marathon in two hours right? Heavy exercise so let's say you were doing what I do and I usually actually do it about this long so let's say you're going and you're doing kickboxing for an hour okay if you do kickboxing for an hour your glycogen stores are dead okay so intense exercise obviously this makes sense right your degradation stores your degradation of your glycogen store is gonna increase with the amount of intensity increasing okay so that's just direct\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "transcription": "================================================================================\n\nSo there's no problem with that. Now, replenishing though. So let's talk about replenishing your muscle glycogen content. So after two hours, this is why a lot of people will feed themselves after, right? For one thing, I drink either a protein shake or something afterwards. That has a lot of sugar and other things in it. Why? You usually during this, not only have you broken down glycogen, but you've usually caused some kind of muscle damage, right? And you want to be able to repair your muscles and your recovery time, right? You'll often hear people talk about recovery time. So post workout. So during those two hours of exercise, I mean, not a whole lot going on. So hours of recovery, usually you can see if you do a high carb diet, you're going to recover quicker. Make sense, right? Because what's glycogen? Glucose, right? It's glucose that's stored away. So obviously a high carb diet is going to restore your glycogen faster, right? Fat and protein diet. We said that we cannot use fats for glycolysis or anything like that, right? Facts can't be used for that. So guess what? They're also not used for making it. Okay, so we're not going to be able to store it. We're going to eat a very fatty or protein rich diet. Okay? No food. Look, you actually recovered a little bit quicker from dough food right away, but then after that, it stops, right? So you definitely would want to eat, but why are you not eating 20 hours afterwards? That's sad, right? If you haven't eaten in five days, you're probably in bad shape anyway, right? I don't know what's happening to you. Okay, but you can see that it still takes a while. So this is why you often feel tired after you've run a half marathon, a whole marathon, or whatever, right? Even though you've slept well and you've rested well, your muscles are tired, everything's tired because you're still needing to recuperate for the next 20 or plus hours, okay?\n\n\n================================================================================"

I know everybody got into low-carb diets for a while, but carbs are important. Good carbs. So, glycogen storage diseases, because what happens if we can't store these? Let's talk about Vaughn-Gurk's disease. So, this is where we have a problem with glucose six phosphates. So, glycogen is normal in structure. Okay, so we were able to make it. Remember how we make glycogen? Does anybody remember? Start out. We link all of these glycotic bonds. We put some branches on it, right? So, glycogen is normal in structure, but present in excess. And that's because glucose six phosphate accumulates in the liver. And it cannot be converted to glucose. And that stimulates glycolicis, and that's going to also cause lactic acidosis. Okay. So, glucose six phosphate accumulates in the liver. Why? What's glucose six phosphates? Huh? What? So, what is glucose six phosphatases function? Glucose six phosphates. Okay. So, glucose six phosphates, right? Please know what it means, what it does. I think we've already talked about it. I want to know what it is. I'm not going to take the answer. Okay. But please know. Choreoidazze. Oh, y'all on this exam. Y'all on this exam. We talked about the Choreoicycle. Okay. Choreoidazze. Everybody would say it. I don't know. Y'all in Choreoicycle. We're going to have to go over it again. Choreoidazze. Debranching enzyme. Right? So, now you have a problem with your debranching enzyme. So, only the outermost branches of glycogen can be degraded, meaning that what is occurring? What breaks down the outermost parts? Amolace. Thank you. Right? So, we said that if this is a branch, and this is a branch, alpha amolace, right? We'll cut until it reaches a point close to the junctures, right? Okay? And then it'll cut this off, right? And then we call this little part what? Yes, limit dexterance. Thank you. So, limit dexterance. Those are cleaved by what? Debranching enzyme. Yes. Yeah, that's the actual name. And then the deeper inching enzyme is usually what I call it. You call it the actual pull name. So, yes. Then that comes through there and moves them, right? Moves it to the end of the long chain so that the alpha amolace can come back and chew it up some more. But if you do not have your debranching enzyme, what are you left with? A bunch of limit dexterance. I'm going to assume, right? Okay. So, if you have query disease, only your outermost branches of your glycotomy degrade in, the symptoms are similar to Von Gurks. So, you're going to get glycolysis, and that's going to cause a lack of gastro dosis. Migrardal disease. Now, this is an actual problem in your muscles. Okay, because Von Gurks, we talked about this accumulation in your liver. Migrardal disease, this is muscle glycogen phosphorylase. If you have an issue with your muscle glycogen phosphorylase, you have an limited ability to perform stereos exercise. Okay. And that means you're going to get easily tired. Lammative ability to perform stereos exercise, gentle exercise is possible. When I say gentle, I mean like walking. And not long distances. Okay.\n\n\n================================================================================"
